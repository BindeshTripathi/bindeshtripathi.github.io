# About
This site is an ongoing attempt to create a brief personal record of my short academic journey thus far.  Instead of duplicating what are already documented on the <a href="https://bindeshtripathi.github.io/CV_Bindesh_Tripathi.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> (as of Jan 2023), I will take the liberty to supplement those here.

After completing an undergraduate degree in physics and a couple of research internships, including one at NORDITA, I began graduate program in physics at University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2019. In my research work, I borrow ideas from the experts in nuclear-fusion-plasma-related turbulence and apply those to astrophysical turbulence, in particular those driven by instabilites, but also waves. Progress is then made using analytical theory and leadership-class computational tools.

For a quick reference, the list of my peer-reviewed published papers are available at https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4723-2170.


## Hobbies
When I'm not thinking about my research work, it is most likely that I'd be found in communities, if not reading books of broad interest.
