# About
This site is an ongoing attempt to create a brief personal record of my academic journey thus far.  Instead of duplicating what is already documented on the <a href="https://bindeshtripathi.github.io/CV_Bindesh_Tripathi.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> (as of Jan 2023), I will take the liberty to supplement those here.

After completing an undergraduate degree in Physics and a couple of research internships abroad, I began graduate program in Physics in the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2019. Little did I know that a professor who was paired with me as a temporary mentor for the first year would become my endless source of inspiration during the graduate school, guiding me as a Ph.D. advisor, alongwith his research team and collaborators, who all are my advisors and mentors. In my research work, I borrow ideas from the experts in nuclear-fusion-related turbulence and apply those to astrophysical turbulence. Progress is made using theoretical and computational tools.

For a quick reference, the list of my peer-reviewed published papers may be found at https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4723-2170.


## Hobbies
While I'm not thinking about my research work, it is most likely that I'd be found either reading books of other genres like personal development and texts based on/inspired by real stories or around communities.

## A Thought
If I must leave a thought for the day, I'd probably be inclined to say, although I'm still practicing, "being disciplined is decidedly difficult---but not overwhelmingly, once a habit formed."
