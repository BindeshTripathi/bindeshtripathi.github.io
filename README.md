# About
This site is an ongoing attempt to create a brief personal record of my academic journey thus far.  Some details may be found on the <a href="https://bindeshtripathi.github.io/CV_Bindesh_Tripathi.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> (as of Jan 2023).

After completing an undergraduate degree in Physics and a couple of research internships abroad, I began graduate program in Physics in the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2019. Little did I know that a professor who was paired with me as a temporary mentor for the first year would become my endless source of inspiration during the graduate school, guiding me as a Ph.D. advisor, alongwith his research team and collaborators---experts in astrophysics and nuclear fusion, with focus on turbulence.

While some in preparation, the list of my peer-reviewed published papers may be found at https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4723-2170.
